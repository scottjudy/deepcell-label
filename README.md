DeepCell Label is a web-based tool to visualize and label biological images. It can segment an image, assign cells across a timelapse, and track divisions in multiplexed images, 3D image stacks, and time-lapse movies.

As it's available through a browser, DeepCell Label can crowdsource data labeling or review, correct, and curate labels as a domain expert.

The site is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [XState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/), and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [runs locally](/documentation/LOCAL_USE.md) or [on the cloud](/documentation/DEPLOYMENT.md).

Visit [label.deepcell.org](https://label.deepcell.org) to create a project from an example file or your own .tiff, .png, or .npz. Dropdown instructions are available while working on a project in DeepCell Label.

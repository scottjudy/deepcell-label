## Instructions for Running Caliban in a Docker Container

In addition to having Docker, you will also need to have a VNC viewer to view the application inside the container. 

To install one, you can go to http://realvnc.com to download a free VNC viewer.
[Direct Link to Download Page](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/)

### Build a Docker Container

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanvalenlab/caliban.git
cd caliban
docker build -t caliban .
```
### Run the New Docker Image

```bash
docker run \
-p 5900:5900 \
-v $PWD/desktop:/usr/src/app/desktop  \
--privileged \
caliban:latest
```
This will launch a new Docker container and run Xvfb, Fluxbox, and a VNC server. To access the containerâ€™s display, point a VNC client to 127.0.0.1.

Inside the VNC client, one can access Caliban through the terminal emulator. Start the terminal by right-clicking the desktop and selecting

```bash
Applications > Terminal Emulators > XTerm
```
Next, enter the following into the terminal and Caliban will start:

```bash
cd desktop
python3 caliban.py [input file location]
```

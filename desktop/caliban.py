        Event handler for keypresses in pyglet window. (Mouse does not have
        to be within window for keypress events to occur, as long as window
        has focus.) Keypresses are context-dependent and are organized into
        helper functions grouped by context. Universal keypresses apply in
        any context, while other keypresses (eg, those that trigger actions)
        are naturally grouped together. Some keybinds occur in specific contexts
        and may be grouped into "misc" helper functions.

        Actions that modify the file are carried out in two steps: a keybind that
        prompts the action, and a subsequent keybind to confirm the decision (and
        choose options, where applicable). Any keybind whose effect is to set
        self.mode to a new Mode object requires a secondary action, often a keybind,
        to confirm. When actions are carried out, self.mode is reset to Mode.none().

        Note: this event handler is called when the key is pressed down. Holding down
        or releasing keys do not affect this event handler. For keys that are being held
        down at time of other events, query self.key_states[key], which makes use of
        pyglet's KeyStateHandler class.

            modifiers: keys like shift, ctrl that are held down at the time of keypress

        Event handler for keypresses in pyglet window. (Mouse does not have
        to be within window for keypress events to occur, as long as window
        has focus.) Keypresses are context-dependent and are organized into
        helper functions grouped by context. Universal keypresses apply in
        any context, while other keypresses (eg, those that trigger actions)
        are naturally grouped together. Some keybinds occur in specific contexts
        and may be grouped into "misc" helper functions.

        Actions that modify the file are carried out in two steps: a keybind that
        prompts the action, and a subsequent keybind to confirm the decision (and
        choose options, where applicable). Any keybind whose effect is to set
        self.mode to a new Mode object requires a secondary action, often a keybind,
        to confirm. When actions are carried out, self.mode is reset to Mode.none().

        or releasing keys do not affect this event handler. For keys that are being held

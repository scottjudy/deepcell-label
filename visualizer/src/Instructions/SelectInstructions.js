      <Typography>
        The foreground is the label that we are adding the canvas. The foreground is highlighted
        with a translucent white. Tools that add to the labeling, like the brush or threshold, will
        add the foreground label. The background label is outlined in red. Tools that remove labeled
        areas, like trim or delete, selects a label as the background when clicking on it, and
        clicking on label selected as the background does the action that removes it.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant='h5'>Foreground/Background Palette</Typography>
      <SelectedPalette />
      <Typography>
        Below the tool bar is a palette widget that shows the current foreground and background. The
        square outlined in white on top shows the foreground, and the square outline in red on
        bottom shows the background.
        <br />
        When the top square is black, the foregorund is no label. Tools will generally replace
        labeled area with unlabeled area.
        <br />
        When the bottom square is black, the background is no label. Tools will generally add new
        labeled area over unlabeled area.
        <br />
        We can switch the selected foreground and background by pressing <kbd>X</kbd> or by pressing
        the swap button <SwitchButton />.
        <br />
        The foreground and background squares also have arrows to cycle between all the labels.

      <Typography>
        While using the Select tool, click on any label to select it as the foreground. Click on the
        foreground label to select it as the background. If you double click on a label, it also
        resets the foreground to no label.

        Select with <kbd>Shift</kbd>
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        While using any tool, you can select labels by holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> and clicking on it.
        Shift clicking on any label first selects it as the background, and shift clicking on the
        background makes it the foreground. Shift with a double click also resets the background to
        no label.

# Caliban Browser Version

This is an outdated version of caliban that ran off of the browser.

The `caliban.py` file is essentially the same as the one in the `desktop/`
folder, but is now outdated.

Flask is used as an HTTP server that serves the frames as pngs and metadata
as JSON. The javascript in the `browser/template` folder is what makes the
requests to the Flask server.
